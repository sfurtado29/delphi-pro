Extract ONLY values that are EXPLICITLY and DIRECTLY stated in the user input.

STRICT RULES — violating these causes serious errors:
- NEVER infer, guess, or imply a value. If the user did not say it word-for-word (or near word-for-word), leave it as "".
- The word "campaign" does NOT imply job_function. Leave job_function as "" unless the user says e.g. "targeting Marketing" or "Sales department".
- "mid-size" or "mid-sized" maps to employee_size. Do NOT map it to revenue_range.
- "tech" or "technology" maps to industry. Do NOT also fill industry_domain unless explicitly stated.
- geography: ONLY if a country, region, or continent is explicitly named (e.g. "US", "USA", "United States", "Europe", "India")
- industry: ONLY if an industry is explicitly named (e.g. "tech", "healthcare", "finance")
- industry_domain: ONLY if a specific sub-sector is explicitly named (e.g. "SaaS", "banking", "retail")
- job_function: ONLY if a department or function is explicitly named (e.g. "Sales", "Marketing", "Engineering", "HR")
- job_level: ONLY if a seniority level is explicitly named (e.g. "C-Level", "CEO", "VP", "Director", "Manager")
- employee_size: ONLY if company size is explicitly stated (e.g. "mid-size", "enterprise", "50-249 employees", "large")
- revenue_range: ONLY if the COMPANY's annual revenue is explicitly mentioned (e.g. "$50M ARR", ">$1B revenue", "mid-market companies").
  A campaign BUDGET like "$30K" or "$500" is NOT a revenue_range — leave it as "".
